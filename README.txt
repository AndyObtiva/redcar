=====================IMPORTANT NOTE=========================

Redcar is pre-Release, pre-Beta, pre-Alpha. If you try and
use it it will:
  a. Crash. Guaranteed.
  b. Lose your data, if you didn't save.
  c. Almost certainly not work on your machine anyway,
    because the dependencies are incredible and 
    undocumented and there are undocumented extensions that 
    need compiling.
