Getting Started
===============

Prerequisites
-------------

Redcar only runs on Linux at the moment, and requires the GTK toolkit
installed. Other dependencies are listed in INSTALL.txt.

Installation
------------

Currently Redcar must be installed from source. Hopefully we can get some
OS packages made before long. Release tarballs are available 
`here <http://redcareditor.com/releases/>`_.

The INSTALL.txt in the source tree contains detailed installation instructions.

Features
--------

Once you have completed installation, you may care to run the integration tests
that come with Redcar::

   rake features

Although errors do not mean Redcar will not run, there are likely to be
missing or broken features.
