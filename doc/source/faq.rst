Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

**When I try to start Redcar I see a "get_node" error**.

  Are you on Jaunty? There seems to be a bug in the ruby-dbus package
  for Jaunty, or a bug in how Redcar uses it. A workaround for now is
  to start Redcar with the flag *--multiple-instances*.

**Super+R (or some other key) doesn't seem to work**

  Do you use Compiz? Many Compiz keybindings conflict with Redcar
  keybindings. Super+R is the default for "Enhanced Zoom Desktop" for
  instance. You can modify Compiz keybindings in the Compiz Settings 
  Manager. You can modify Redcar keybindings by looking in the source :)
