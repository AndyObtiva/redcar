  <p id="description">A bomb was detonated on my London Underground carriage on 7/7/2005, killing 26 people behind me. 52 were killed, over 700 were injured in the terrorist atrocities. I was amazingly fortunate. I walked away with only minor injuries. When I got home I wrote down what had happened to me. Strangers and friends from all over the world wanted to know more.
And so I tried to make sense of it all, and I continued to write, anonymously.

	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>So I'm back after going up north for a few days to see J's family, and on my return I find my inbox full of kind people's messages pointing out this <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6155932.stm">gem</a>...<br /><br />Matthew Taylor, Tony Blair's outgoing chief strategy adviser <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6155932.stm">fears ''the internet'' </a>could be fuelling a "crisis" in the relationship between politicians and voters. Mr. Taylor talked of the "shrill discourse of demands" made by those tiresome voters behaving like ''teenagers'', "conflicted" about what they actually want - and the nasty off-message bloggers are apparently to blame. He says<br /><br /><em>''What is the big breakthrough, in terms of politics, on the web in the last few years? It's basically blogs which are, generally speaking, hostile and, generally speaking, basically see their job as every day exposing how venal, stupid, mendacious politicians are. ''<br />"The internet is being used as a tool of mobilisation, which is fantastic, but it only adds to the growing, incommensurate nature of the demands being made on government."<br />He challenged the online community</em> <span style="color:#000099;">[ the <a href="http://notsaussure.wordpress.com/2006/11/17/wheres-me-online-community-leader-got-to/">what?]</a></span><a href="http://notsaussure.wordpress.com/2006/11/17/wheres-me-online-community-leader-got-to/"> </a><em>to provide more opportunities for "people to try to understand the real trade-offs that politicians face and the real dilemmas that citizens face".</em><br /><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6155932.stm">( more via the BBC) </a><br /><br />Oh dear. Poor politicians, faced with this ghastly dilemma of what to do after stumbling across the angry thoughts of their electorate. And what, pray, is wrong with blogs exposing how venal, stupid and mendacious politicans are - if politicians are behaving in a way which is venal, stupid and mendacious?<br /><br />Look, it's quite simple. If you don't want voters blogging angrily about venality, stupidity or menaciousness in politics, clean up your act. Stop <em>venally</em> taking bungs and then installing the donors as lawmakers, stop passing <em>stupid</em> laws without proper consultation, stop <em>lying</em> about the build-up to illegal wars.<br /><br />Or, if you are going to carry on, stop whinging when you are exposed for it and ordinary people say, quite reasonably, that they are utterly fed up with you .<br /><br />Voters have <em>always</em> been angry about venality, stupidlity and menadaciousness in politics; the problem for New Labour (and all the other parties) is that they can now read about exactly <em>how</em> angry the pesky voters are. Does Blair's strategy chappie look chagrined on learning this, and vow to carry back the message that the Government must do better to regain voters' trust? No, he goes and has a hissy fit at a conference. (<em>It's not the Government themselves who are having a crisis. Because the stroppy voters have retired to their bedrooms and slammed the door having lost faith in politicians and politics, oh no. It's the nasty intranetwebthing. Ruining the ''relationship'' between politicians and voters. )</em><br /><br />What, us voicing critical opinions? Talking back on our little personal blogs? That buggers up the ''relationship'' between Government and governed, does it? I'm sorry, but I don't want to be in a ''relationship'' where one side has all the power and the other side just shuts up and does what it is told without complaining. That's an abusive relationship.<br /><br /><em>Part of the problem, he added, was the "net-head" culture itself, which was rooted in libertarianism and "anti-establishment" attitudes.</em><br /><em></em><br />Oh, this is pathetic. <em>''Net-head culture''</em>? Have you read the newspapers recently, Matthew-the-ex-strategy adviser? Looked at opinion columns, cartoons, polls? Watched TV? Been to a pub, even? Talked to any voters, <em>at all, in the last five years</em>?<br /><br />*Deep breath*<br /><br />Dear Government. You have an awful lot of power. You seem to be on a mission to get even more. You don't seem to be listening to the voters whom you are elected to serve. We've tried voting, and we've tried not voting, we've tried turning out on the streets in our millions, we've tried writing to you, signing petitions, some of us even got to meet you and tried to talk to you face to face, and now, wearied by the general lack of interest in our concerns, hoarse from shouting at our TV sets, some of us have now started writing down our thoughts on our personal web diaries.<br /><br />Y' know, <em>engaging</em>. Giving a stuff. Debating. <em>Caring</em>. Being transparent about what we think. (Thought you were once keen on that sort of thing?) All over the UK, people from ''hard working families'', normal voting members of the public, men and women of all ages, all political persuasions, are simply sitting down at a keyboard and writing what's on their mind when they see the news, when they see politicans on TV, when they read what politicians say<br /><br />And boo, hoo, you don't like it. Well, then, <em>why not look at the causes of our ire </em>? Look at yourselves. Explain yourselves. We're listening. The slightly encouraging thing is, that now, possibly, you might be listening or at least reading, too. Although that's actually quite scary, given what happened when you didn't like the messages you got from disparate people protesting in Parliament Square. You made Parliament Square and the surrounding area a no-protest zone, didn't you? Great.<br /><br />Are you going to try and close down the seditious and ungrateful blogosphere next?<br /><br />Quite possibly. Well, hey, blog while you can, people, say what's on your minds. Nobody is stopping you. Yet. The Government might even be reading.<br /><br />And just remember, nobody has to read this stuff if they don't want to, and if they do, they don't have to agree. But any Government wonks reading might want to consider this. Seems like lots of blogging voters - independently of each other - do seem to be expressing somewhat similar thoughts , even though they come from all sorts of different persuasions, and from right across the political spectrum. The fact that parents and students and office workers and G.Ps and lawyers and magistrates and musicians and soldiers and coppers and train drivers and ambulance dispatchers and nurses and teachers and journalists and priests and writers and programmers and photographers and farmers and painters and carers and councillors...<br /><br />...have recently felt moved, individually and variously, to begin blogging and say they are pig-sick of the Government's behaviour...<br /><br />... might perhaps be a teeny indication that there might be something that's striking a chord amongst the huddled masses yearning to be free...<br /><br />... and the crisis might be a bit closer to home for the Government than the flipping ''internet''.<br /><br /><a href="http://politics.slashdot.org/politics/06/11/17/1630255.shtml">A cross voter writes on Slashdot</a>...<br /><br /><span style="font-family:times new roman;">''Dear Matthew, (can I call you Matthew?)<br /><br />Your government is elected by a minority of the electorate using a system that gives it an overwhelming majority in the House of Commons. Your Members of Parliament say their first loyalty is to the Party and the manifesto, not to the electorate. You ensure almost all votes are whipped through Parliament with fearful penalties if an MP disobeys the Party line. You have changed your Party conferences so that votes by the members have no bearing on policy making which is performed behind closed doors. You refuse freedom of information requests that would allow the electorate to see that policies are enacted according to regulations. You take money from multimillionaires and do not declare it to the authorities; coincidentally, all of these donors then become members of the House of Lords where they become law makers. You pass legislation that require people to get police permission to protest outside of Parliament. You rip up ancient laws that regulate the power of the State over the citizen and propose to take more for yourselves. You politicise the intelligence service, getting your spin doctors to sell a war planned in collusion with a foreign power.<br /><br />You shouldn't be so much wondering why voters feel alienated, as be amazed that we haven't dragged you out of Downing Street and strung you up outside of Parliament''</span><br /><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"></span><br /><span style="font-family:georgia;">Ho hum. </span><br /><br />UPDATE: <a href="http://www.blairwatch.co.uk/node/1461#comment">Blairwatch</a> ( lefty, fed up with Blair) and <a href="http://iaindale.blogspot.com/2006/11/libertarian-shrill-and-proud-of-it.html">Ian Dale </a>( righty, fed up with Blair) both picked up the story too, which kind of proves the cross-party point.<br /><br />UPDATE UPDATE: Still finding more links...<a href="http://nether-world.blogspot.com/2006/11/git-of-week-1-of-occasional-series.html">Netherworld</a> (lefty/liberal), <a href="http://5thnovember.blogspot.com/2006/11/crisis-what-crisis.html">Guido</a> (libertarian right), <a href="http://paullinford.blogspot.com/2006/11/new-labour-new-media.html">Paul Linford</a> ( ex Parliamentary lobby journalist), <a href="http://devilskitchen.blogspot.com/2006/11/matthew-taylor-prize-fucktard.html">Devil's Kitchen </a>( sweary libertarian), hmmm...I'm going to stop putting blogger's affiliations now as this will take ages, you get the idea, people from all over the shop...<a href="http://bloodandtreasure.typepad.com/blood_treasure/2006/11/venal_stupid_me.html">Blood&amp; Treasure</a>, <a href="http://rhetoricallyspeaking.blogspot.com/2006/11/bloggers-v-mendacious-bastards.html">Bookdrunk</a>, <a href="http://timworstall.typepad.com/timworstall/2006/11/matthew_taylor.html">TimWorstall</a>, <a href="http://martinkelly.blogspot.com/2006/11/they-are-coming-for-bloggers.html">Martin Kelly</a>., <a href="http://www.longrider.co.uk/blog/2006/11/18/we-are-the-problem/">Longrider</a>, <a href="http://mreugenides.blogspot.com/2006/11/shrill-discourse-of-demands.html">Mr Eugenides</a>, <a href="http://bagsrants.blogspot.com/2006/11/matthew-taylor-gets-it-right.html">Bag</a>, <a href="http://atoryblog.blogspot.com/2006/11/we-must-be-doing-something-right.html">Man in a Shed</a>, <a href="http://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2006/11/matthew_taylor_.html">Stumbling and Mumbling</a>, <a href="http://jamescleverly.blogspot.com/2006/11/blairs-pet-policy-wonk-doesnt-get-it.html">James Cleverly</a>, The <a href="http://thetindrummer.blogspot.com/2006/11/matthew-taylor.html">Tin Drummer</a>, <a href="http://modies.blogspot.com/2006/11/more-shrill-discourse-please.html">Shuggy</a>, <a href="http://d-notice.blogspot.com/2006/11/then-they-came-for-bloggers.html">D-Notice</a>, <a href="http://budgiebird.blogspot.com/2006/11/were-british-politicians-no-criticism.html">BudgieBird</a> and <a href="http://notsaussure.wordpress.com/2006/11/17/wheres-me-online-community-leader-got-to/">Not Saussure</a>.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>FROM THE LONDON ASSEMBLY 7 JULY REVIEW COMMITTEE<br /><br /><span style="font-size:85%;"><em>''To survivors of the 7 July attacks who gave their views in person to the London Assembly 7 July Review Committee [and to interested members of the public - RN]<br />I am writing to let you know that the 7 July Review Committee is about to hold its follow-up review to look at what progress has been made in implementing its recommendations. </em><br /><em></em><br /><em>The agenda for the 22 November meeting of the London Assembly's 7 July Review Committee has been published (and can be found <a href="http://www.london.gov.uk/assembly/resilience/2006/77reviewnov22/agenda.jsp">here</a>).</em><br /><br /><em>At the bottom of the page is a set of documents which are all the responses we received following publication of our report in June. </em><br /><br /><em>The follow-up meeting will take place here at City Hall at 2pm on <strong>22 November</strong>, in the meeting Chamber. The meeting will be attended by senior representatives from the emergency services, Transport for London, and the National Health Service. The Committee will ask them questions about what progress they have made on key issues such as underground communications, digital radios / alternatives to mobile telephones, and putting in place plans to care for survivors of major incidents. </em><br /><em></em><br /><strong><em>The meeting will be open to the public, so you are welcome to come and watch the meeting. It will also be webcast live and available to view afterwards. </em></strong><br /></span><strong><br /></strong><span style="font-size:85%;"><em>If you have any questions or concerns, please give us a call.

Also, if you would like to suggest questions for the Committee to ask the representatives of London's emergency, transport and health services, please let me know. I cannot guarantee that all the suggested questions will be asked, but I will ensure that they are passed on to the Assembly Members. I will need your suggestions by 9am on Monday 20th November in order to brief the Committee.</em><br /></strong><em></em><br /><em>Following the meeting, I am expecting the Committee to produce a short follow-up report, and I will let you know as soon as I know when that is likely to be published. I will over the next 24 hours be sending out e-mails to everyone we have on our contact lists, but do please feel free to pass this information on to anyone you think may be interested.

I haven't stopped campaigning, just had a break from highly visible <em>public</em> campaigning as I am fed up of being heckled when I speak out and getting bonkers emails and comments from conspiraloons, (and it is not as if I want to be some kind of flipping 'bomb celebrity' with all the utter lunacy that that entails). So putting my head over the paraphet only happens when I think it is really necessary and will achieve something in terms of raising awareness of this huge public issue concerning managing our freedom and our fear, our safety and civil liberties, and our ability to integrate with each other. And what we know - and need to know, still - about how safe we are today - and how we got to this point where we all worry about ordinary people going to work and never coming home again.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

	 The Rules of the Game...

    </h3>


	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Back in September, I wrote a bit of doggrel, called <a href="http://rachelnorthlondon.blogspot.com/2006/09/rules-of-game-have-changed.html">THE RULES OF THE GAME HAVE CHANGED </a>that was <a href="http://www.stablesound.co.uk/mp3/rachelnorth/rulesofthegame.mp3">set to music </a>by Ecletech, Doghorse and Bo Bo'dor. The title (and refrain of the verses) was of course inspired by Tony Blair's <a href="http://www.number10.gov.uk/output/Page8041.asp">famous statement</a> in a press conference in August 2005 when he announced, ominously<br /><br /><em>'Let no-one be in any doubt, that the rules of the game are changing'</em><br /><br />Today, the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust publishes a report called 'The Rules of the Game:Terrorism, Community and Human Rights' ( <a href="http://www.jrrt.org.uk/Terrorism_final.pdf">read it here on PDF</a>) <div><em></em></div>The <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;jsessionid=CGIU4VGOZX3Y5QFIQMFCFFWAVCBQYIV0?xml=/news/2006/11/13/uterror113.xml">Telegraph writes </a><em>''</em><em>The Government's anti-terrorism policy is being damaged by party political interests and vote-seeking on the part of ministers, a report has claimed.<br /><br />The report singles out John Reid for particular criticism<br />It also </em><a lang="en.uk" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/11/11/nterr11.xml"><em>accused Tony Blair and John Reid, the Home Secretary, of playing to a "tabloid agenda"</em></a><em> and "trying to win over the white working class vote."<br />Sensible plans to combat terror are now being "submerged by the Government's 'electoral motives'</em><br /><em>The respected think-tank warned that<a lang="en.uk" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/08/13/nterr13.xml"> anti-terror measures were having a disproportionate effect </a>on Britain's Muslim community and risked alienating people who could play a vital role in defeating extremism</em><em>"</em><br /><br />The report says 'The fundemental point at issue, is whether new laws and oversight procedures are necessary for dealing with the changed nature of terrorism or whether such contrivances are merely politically cosmetic knee-jerk responses with no substantive adantages but with potential counter-productive disadvantages.'<br /><br />Well quite. See<a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,1945823,00.html"> Henry Porter</a>, writing brilliantly (as usual) in last week's Observer to an incisive and powerful statement as to why we should preserve our civil liberties, even in a time of terror and what that might mean in practical terms.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.mi5.gov.uk/output/Page568.html">Dame Eliza laid out the threat</a>. Brilliant police work and keen intelligence caught <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-2440174,00.html">Dhiren Barot</a>, a murderous fanatic who planned to kill thousands. The threat is real. But it is not so very different to other threats we have faced before, and we did not rip up the rule book then. We do not defeat it by watching our politicians grandstanding and abusing State powers to cow and control the law-abiding many in order to catch the lawless, murderous few. Nor do we need to sink to the level of murderous fanatics by sanctioning brutality, torture, inprisonment without charge and wild bellicose rhetoric, unaccountable half-truths, whilst claiming that God is on our side.<br /><br />And this latest report very sensibly makes this point in a timely fashion. Let's hope its sane message isn't drowned out by more tough-guy posturing during the forthcoming Queen's Speech, new attempts to get <a href="http://rachelnorthlondon.blogspot.com/2005/11/90-days-and-90-nights.html">90 days Internment</a> back on the agenda, and yet more chest-beating from Reid and Brown about who's the Toughest on Terror.<br /><br />As the US neo-cons unravel, you'd think the time for calmer voices calling for thoughtful debate would be heard. But politicians think they can win votes and leadership elections by swinging their dicks and stamping their feet and bellowing like gorillas with the tabloids gibbering a chorus.Until we stop indulging these macho ego-displays and grow up, we'll continue to get hysteria, fear, demonisation of Muslims and the febrile atmosphere of anger, suspicion and cynicism that such an explosive atmosphere brews.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

	 Hot Topic: 'Cold Turkey'

    </h3>


	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>From the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6142416.stm">BBC,</a> <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/11/13/ndrug13.xml">Telegraph</a> and many other papers, comes the news that some prisoners have settled out of court after being forced to go 'cold turkey' in prison, which they claimed was 'assualt' and 'a breach of their human rights.'<br /><br />More than half of all prisoners in England and Wales report a serious drug problem, and on entering the prisons, that figure can be as high as 70-80%. People are on drugs and committing crimes to pay for them, and ending up in prisons, where their treatment and rehabiliatation is inadequate , and where drugs are rife inside.<br /><br />From the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6142416.stm">BBC </a><br />'According to the editor of the Prisons Handbook, Mark Leech, two-thirds of crime is drug-related and Home Office research has shown that 643 drug addicts were responsible for well over 70,000 offences in one three-month period.<br />"Prisoners have the right to receive exactly the same type and standard of healthcare in prison as they would receive in the community," he said.<br />"Yet for the most part drug detoxification in prison is second-rate in standard and woefully short in its duration."<br /><br />It seems that the prisoners in this case <em>were already recieving treatment to get off drugs</em> after all, which indicates a willingness to get clean, but then the form the treatment took once they got into prison - or the lack of treatment and support recieved- seems to indicate that they were suddenly hauled off the drugs rather than walked off the drugs. I have no doubt that it was a grim experience. But if the outcome was that they were drug-free, rather faster and more brutally than they would like, isn't that still a positive outcome?<br /><br />We haven't been told what the prisoners think. Did the prisoners manage to stay off drugs after the detox? Or did they just score some more inside the prison walls as soon as they possibly could? If they did, was it because the forced cold turkey experience was so awful? Or because they couldn't function without opiates, and methadone, heroin, whatever would do, and what they resented was being painfully forced to stop in a way that was out of their control?<br /><br />The drugs trap is not just physical, after all but psychological. Being forced to go 'cold turkey' against your will , with little help or supportive treatment is quite possibly counter-productive. Perhaps the prisoners feared that they would be unable to stop themselves scoring again, after enduring the sudden 'cold turkey' experience, rather than a managed detox, and that was why they fought for the right to have proper drug treatment, and stop slowly, because they wanted a real chance to succeed in getting off drugs. Having your medical treatment suddenly halted, without consultation, is undoubtedly damaging, and inhumane.<br /><br />I don't especially see why they should get thousands in compensation though. An apology, certainly, if they were given sub-standard medical treatment, after starting a detox course to get clean, and then suddenly having treatment stopped and being forced to go 'cold turkey' with no choice or support in the matter.<br /><br />Prisoners, like anyone else who is addicted to opiates should be supported and treated to help them get off drugs, criminal behaviour as a result of addiction to drugs being the reason for more than half of prisoners being in jail in the first place . Prisons should be drug-free. They aren't, they are<em> </em>usually places where drugs are easily available.<br /><br />Maybe it is easier to manage a doped and apathetic prison population, given the huge problems in overcrowded jails, and maybe the Home Office was worried about what would come out in the court case, so they paid up to shut the men up rather than have the facts emerge. Imagine a case where medical treatment to manage coming off drugs was deliberately withheld for sadistic or punitive purposes for example. Or because there wasn't money for treatment and counsellors. That would not make happy headlines, nor would lurid details emerging of just how many drugs are sold and used in many of the U.K's jails.<br /><br />The key issue isn't really the compensation awarded in this case, though, ( even though it grates a bit). The bigger picture is the whole problem of substance abuse and custodial sentencing trends and prison overcrowding and rehabilitation. And the unpopular notion that prisoners have human rights too, and shouldn't just be stuffed into brutally overcrowded prisons where they will get madder and angrier and more f*cked up and more brutalised because where does that gets us all, in the end? Reoffending rates are going through the roof.<br /><br />Prisons, which ex-prisoner and Guardian writer Erwin James describes as <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4768496.stm">'hate factories' </a>I think should be kept for the most violent and serious offenders, with a far greater emphasis placed on rehabiliation, training and education and drug treatment in the community for other offenders. Prisons should not be dumping grounds for the mentally ill, the addicted, the marginalised, brutalised and the desperate.<br /><br />But all too often they are, and the standards of care in prison are erratic, because the system is so overcrowded. There is help for those who want it, in some prisons, some of the time, and some of the help is excellent. At other times, and other places there isn't the staff or the funding or resources to make a difference and help the offender improve or change.<br /><br />And the increasingly punitive attitude towards criminals and crime, which does not distinguish between the dangerous and the desperate, and which dehumanises prisoners, and stigmatises them on release, does not help. Some prisoners are truly 'bad', some 'mad', but others know their behaviour is anti-social and want to have the chance to change and become useful members of society. Those that we can help, we should, as much as we could, for all our sakes. Those that cannot or will not stop committing vicious or violent crimes we have no choice but to keep locked up.<br /><br /><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4812924.stm">Some prisoners' stories</a><br /><br />UPDATE: <a href="http://timesonline.typepad.com/comment/">Daniel Finkelstein </a>on the Times links to a prison doctor who writes that <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,1072-569007,00.html">cold turkey is 'no worse than 'flu'</a>.

	 Restorative Justice

    </h3>


	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>I wrote yesterday about being approached to work on a possible TV series about restorative justice, and touched briefly on my reservations about whether my case was suitable. Before I called the researcher back, I did some reading up on restorative justice, and some good links can be found here ( <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs/occ-resjus.pdf">Home Office report </a>- pdf, <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/crime-victims/victims/restorative-justice/">Home Office page </a>, <a href="http://www.crimereduction.gov.uk/workingoffenders/workingoffenders42.htm">Government Strategy </a>with regard to restorative justice, <a href="http://www.transformingconflict.org/Restorative_Approaches_and_Practices.htm">Transforming Conflict </a>( education site) <a href="http://www.thamesvalley.police.uk/news_info/info/rj/pdf/acpo1.pdf">ACPO Response </a>(pdf) to Government's Strategy on Restorative Justice, Joseph Rowntree site on <a href="http://www.jrf.org.uk/knowledge/findings/socialpolicy/542.asp">Thames Valley Police restorative cautioning, and the impressive results </a>)<br /><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restorative_justice">Wiki</a> also has a good round up of links and explanations as to the main ways in which restorative justice is practised throughout the world through mediation, community justice boards, healing circles and so on. <a href="http://www.restorativejustice.org.uk/">RestorativeJustice.org.uk </a>is the main UK site for exploring and finding out about restorative justice, and here I quote from their home page where there is a definition of what restorative justice is:<br /><br /><em>Restorative Justice is a process whereby:<br />(i) All the parties with a stake in a particular conflict or offence come together to resolve collectively how to deal with the aftermath of the conflict or offence and its implications for the future, and;<br />(ii) Offenders have the opportunity to acknowledge the impact of what they have done and to make reparation and victims have the opportunity to have their harm or loss acknowledged and amends made." </em><br /><br />Basically, restorative justice is a way to deal practically and positively with the fall out of crime on the victim, the offender and the community. The criminal justice system treats the victim as a witness only, with the State acting as the injured party and delivering justice. Though new measures such as Victim Impact Statements/Victim Personal Statements have been introduced so that the victim can communicate something of the effect of the crime on them to the court, there is little in the criminal justice system to make the process anything other than an artificial, ritualised and often frightening process which can, in the worst instances, re-traumatise the victim. The offender is the passive focus of the system, and is supposed to meekly accept punishment; there is no language of healing or rehabilitation, nor is there any restitution or attempt to make amends.<br /><br />Restorative justice - letting victim and offender speak to each other, listen and be heard and validated is much more like the way humans naturally resolve their differences and communicate with each other, rather than the highly-formalised structures and language of the court. And it does seem to have a positive effect, on victim recovery rates, on re-offending rates and on community satisfaction and sense of justice having been done. And I support the idea of and practice of RJ wholeheartedly. I would love to embrace it and be a part of it.<br /><br />Here is a<a href="http://www.thamesvalley.police.uk/news_info/info/rj/victim-story.htm"> good example of restorative justice in action</a>, told by Helen, a victim.<br /><br />The problem I am having in my case is that, unfortunately <em>I just don't think it will work</em>. Cases of serious sexual assault or murder are not usually considered suitable for RJ, ( though there has been sterling stuff done in Northern Ireland and South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Committees). But cases where the offender shows no remorse or has a mental condition that precludes him feeling empathy, shame or remorse are usually not considered suitable for attempts at RJ .<br /><br />In the case of my 2002 violent stranger-rape, I went to every single court hearing and I went through a trial, and I attended every attempt at a sentencing hearing ( there were endless delays and delaying tactics and changing of pleas and sacking of counsel by the defendant) and the rapist never, ever displayed any remorse at all. Right up until the end, he still denied culpability and ludicrously claimed the attack was consensual. He lied and lied. He was unable to even read out the oath, being illiterate, yet he claimed to have been reading his lines for a play before the offence, instead of loitering on the streets looking for victims and ( probably) smoking crack. He denied robbing me, even though he made dozens of calls from my stolen mobile to a drug dealer. He had no explanation for the injuries on my body, and there were over fifty, nor could he explain why I was found tied up and covered in blood with a wire noose around my neck. He mumbled throughout, and would not meet my eyes, and was dumb and gaping when moved away in questioning from his pre-prepared excuses about how he had ''met the lady'' walking home and ''offered to carry the lady's [plastic carrier] bag and handbag''.<br /><br />The judge, when he eventually sentenced him, after psychiatric reports had been made, described him as ''extremely violent'' and ''a danger to women'' with ''worrying elements of sadism'' in his actions, and described me as ''an honest, reliable and truthful witness''. Throughout the whole judicial process my attacker did nothing to help the case proceed smoothly, in fact he obstructed it at every turn. He never showed any feelings at all apart from violent anger, or sadistic pleasure in being in control when attacking me, and in the court, either blankness or occasional self-pity.<br /><br />I absolutely cannot see the point in trying to have any sort of conversation with such a person.<br /><br />And I have nothing to say to him. I think I might as well try and talk to an axe.<br /><br />As to feeling empowered; I <em>never felt like</em> <em>a ''victim''</em>. I held onto my power almost all the way through. I lost it only for a few moments, when he burst into my flat, and began to beat me, and I begged him to stop, and he told me to shut up, and continued to beat me, and make me his prisoner, his thing to abuse and humilate and hurt.<br /><br />But then I got what control I could back, when I decided I would do anything necessary to stay alive. That was when I felt it, the power I never knew I had.<br /><br />From the minute when he began raping me, and I disassociated from the attack, knowing he could never violate my essential self or rape my soul.<br /><br />At the moment when I knew I had defeated his attempt to kill me by feigning my own death.<br /><br />When I decided to come back into my body after he had left me; when I got to my feet, bound and escaped from the house and got help.<br /><br />When I said to the police, <em>I have been raped, find him. </em><br /><em></em><br />When I let the police take the evidence of my body and my home and held nothing back, trusting that justice would come this way.<br /><br />When my love came to me in hospital and his eyes and his smile showed me that we had had lost nothing, that we loved each other more for having nearly been so cruelly separated.<br /><br />When I gave the police statement on video camera, and told all I could remember of the assault, and was not ashamed to speak of it; when I couldn't remember, I gave permission for a Professor of forensic Psychology to work with the police using new techniques on me in interview to unlock the suppressed memories locked down by masssive trauma-amnesia, even though I knew it would hurt me.<br /><br />When I went out of my house, and went to the shops, even though I was nauseous with fear that he was somewhere waiting for me, to finish me off.<br /><br />When I went back to work and said I had taken the time off because a stranger had tried to kill me, and yes, he had raped me.<br /><br />When I got the call from the police '<em> We've got him, Rachel.'</em><br /><em></em><br />All those times when I put on my suit and went to court and stared him down, holding J's hand and the police officer's hand.<br /><br />When the judge pronounced me truthful, and he a liar, and then he was taken away and I looked at his face for, I hope, the very last time.<br /><br />All those times, I was not a victim; I still had power.<br /><br />And now, I still have my power. And my life, and my love, and my family and friends, and my freedom and my voice and my words.<br /><br />And he has nothing. Nothing at all.<br /><br />So I do not feel the need for anything to be ''restored'' to me with restorative justice, since I am more than restored; I am strengthened and empowered and I have a life that is richer and sweeter and more satisfying for having nearly lost it. And I know the redemptive power of love, and compassion, and justice, and how it is always stronger than hate and anger and lies.<br /><br />Perhaps restorative justice would help my offender. But I owe him nothing.<br /><br />Perhaps it would help society, if it helped to rehabilitate him and prevent him reoffending again. But I have already done my bit: I gave evidence, with some of his other victims, and I helped to get him out of society and sent down, locked safely away, so he couldn't hurt people any more.<br /><br />And there are other victims to consider: how would they feel if they saw him again on TV? And anyway, I do not think, as I said, that he is capable of feeling remorse or wanting to ''make amends''. I think the only reason he would agree to be part of a restorative justice effort is if he thought he could get something out of it, like time off his sentence, or earlier parole, or better treatment in prison or something.<br /><br />I honestly do not see the point of ever having anything more to do with that man ever again. And there are dangers too: already I have spoken out about it, and I worry that his family or friends may seek to come after me, and hurt me, though I have my legal right to anonymity to protect me. I am known as ''Rachel North'' now, not my real name. I need that protection, still.<br /><br />People sometimes ask me about forgiveness: do I forgive this man? They act as if it is something I ought to do, I have to do, in order to ''move on''. But I <em>have</em> moved on: I never think of him anymore. At least, I didn't, for years. I am only writing about it now because I was approached to make a programme about the subject of what happened two days ago, and because I am writing a book about PTSD, and so it is on my mind again.<br /><br />I do not 'forgive' this man, not in the Christian sense of the word. I have written about this before in the <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2092-1892288,00.html">Sunday Times</a> when I said:<br /><br /><em>''Does this mean I can foresee myself forgiving the man who raped me? Forgiveness is defined as “compassionate feelings that support a willingness to forgive” or “the act of excusing a mistake or offence”. I have some compassionate feelings towards him already, as I can see that he is a human, not a monster. I do not excuse what he did, but he is not my problem any more. Part of the process of justice is that he is society’s problem now. I am free of him. If he can rehabilitate himself over the years ahead so that he is no longer a threat to women, then he should be let out, having served his sentence.</em> ''<br /><br />Later I expanded on this in a piece I wrote called <a href="http://rachelnorthlondon.blogspot.com/2006/03/f-word.html">'The F Word' </a><br /><br /><em>''For me forgiveness is about moving through the storm of pain and outrage, holding onto my essential self, which was there before the devastating event. It’s hard to let go of the desire for revenge: anger became my sole driver in the months after the first attack.But to be trapped in a state of permanent rage hurts me. I hold what has happened to me, the rape, the bomb, and I try to live through it. I do not want to live a life defined entirely by an attack on me.</em><br /><em></em><br /><em>Forgiveness is a choice, and a gift I make to myself, to live freely in the light, rather than to be trapped in a hell of hatred and vengefulness. It has little to do with the perpetrators of the crimes; it is for me, not them that I choose to do this. It is how I stay sane.</em><br /><em></em><br /><em>When I cannot go any further, I lean on others; my partner, my family, my friends and fellow passengers. I have found that the only way to get past hate and cruelty is to look for where there is still love. I have put up walls to survive in the past; I have used my anger like armour. I could not bear to be so vulnerable in the months after the rape, so I did what I could to protect my devastated self. It took time to forgive myself for being so painfully human. But I found that my vulnerability was my strength. I am human: and I live amongst humans in an imperfect world. The only world that we know.</em><br /><em></em><br /><em>A world where, yes, there is horrifying pain and injustice and cruelty, but also, still beauty and kindness and hope. Wounds take time to heal, and eight months is such a little time. I do not forgive in the Christian sense of the word. I do not exonerate. I move past, I let go, I walk through this and I walk on, leaving the bomber and the rapist and the anger behind me. It is the hardest thing I have ever done.''</em><br /><em></em><br />And I still feel the same as I did when I wrote that last year.<br /><br />So, here we are, (and what a long and grim post that was. November is the time of darkness, introspection, death, decay and shadows. You have to go through it, in order to get to Spring. But I am sorry if I have made you gloomy on your Sunday, reading this. )<br /><br />I left it like this: I said to the programme researcher that if they could get a forensic psychologist's report on my attacker, as to whether he could feel emotions such as remorse, then I would think about the programme, even though my instincts are telling me not to do it. I think that if meeting him will help to stop him reoffending on release, then morally, I should try to do what I can to facilitate that outcome.<br /><br />As to the other past crime which still affects me: the bomber is dead.<br /><br />So there is no restorative justice to be had there, either.<br /><br />And I think restorative justice has its limits, unfortunately, and today I found examples of them. But I would be interested to know what you think.<br /><br />UPDATE: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4878834.stm">BBC article on restorative justice </a>which I found very thought-provoking. Maybe I will see my attacker, after all,( but only if a psychologist says he can now ''do'' empathy.) Maybe I will go and talk to other prisoners instead, as someone in that article did. And I am in awe of the sister of one of the West victims, who sees murderers in prison.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

	 Needling thoughts

    </h3>


	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>I lay for an hour yesterday with twenty or more needles stuck into my head and body, contemplating the direction my life has taken since I left my ad job a few weeks ago. I am in a period of transition; that much is clear. I have taken a short break from writing the book. The first five chapters were evisceratingly honest and involved ripping out my worst thoughts and fears and writing them down. It threw me back into dark places, and there were times when I had to struggle to the surface for breath, and turn my face away from the screen, and look at the weakening sun. Afterwards, I felt drained, and afraid. The long shadows of the past were haunting me again, and I was reliving them, day after day, writing it all down, and it was hard, and I wondered when I would ever be free of them completely.<br /><br />Why am I writing it then? Because I<em> have</em> to: until this PTSD book is done I can't write anything else. And because it is helping me, and I hope it will help others when it is done. Because when my world fell in, all I wanted to read were the stories of others who survived, and to draw hope and strength from their journeys. And to find out what the hell was happening to me. The symptoms of PTSD are frightening, and there is little information about them.<br /><br />So I have been trying to look after myself, whilst I work on this project, and trying to protect myself from darkness and negativity; hence the acupuncture, the going for walks with dogs and friends, the daily engaging with fellow-humans, and being open to what life throws at me, whilst shielding myself from what is malicious and toxic and untruthful. Trusting that justice will come, though it may take a while. Knowing that I walk in the light, and the dark shadows are phantoms, memories, other people's projections and cannot touch me unless I invite them in.<br /><br />Sometimes life sends you strong hints about what you are supposed to be doing with yourself. Last week I spent some time with a writer and a BBC director, they had asked me to talk to them about a terrorism drama they were working on, set in the future, a few years after July 7th 2005. I kept saying, look, I don't speak for all victims, (unless specifically asked to speak by a group). Only for myself, and my opinion is no more important than anyone else's: I only write about what is going on in my life on my blog, like millions of other bloggers, because it is <em>there</em> in my life at the moment. I don't have any special wisdom or insight just because I was on that train: I could have been <em>anybody</em>. That's the whole point.<br /><br />I just write, because that is what I am; that is what I do. I read about terrorism, and crime, and politics, yes, and I think about terrorism and crime and politics, because it has affected me, and people I care about. But if you were to get on any Piccadilly line train at 8.40am on a Thursday, and talk to the passengers you would find hundreds of opinions about the world, and all of them as valid as mine.<br /><br />But they said that they wanted to hear from me, because there is a character in the drama who is like me, so that was all right, and I was interested and happy to talk to them and I hope it helped them.<br /><br />This week, three more people contacted me about doing some TV stuff. I had dinner with a researcher who contacted me to brainstorm some ideas about authoring documentaries. I'm still thinking about that. I have some ideas bubbling. (And not necessarily ideas about rape or terrorism. There is more to my life than just being a survivor of horrible things, after all.)<br /><br />But 'surviving horror' does still come into my life on a daily basis. Yesterday, I got a call from Jane, one of the police officers who had worked on my 2002 rape case. I am still in touch intermittently with some of the police who stood at my side and fought for me in the time of worst darkness, who I will always be grateful to for their compassion and determination.<br /><br />Jane was the officer who first interviewed my attacker when he was brought into a South London police station after mugging a woman, and the chain of events that brought him to justice got properly started. That we got justice at all is partly due to the bravery and instincts of two women who were instrumental in bringing my attacker in.<br /><br />The first woman was a victim, whom my attacker followed, then beat and robbed, taking her bag and phone, using far, far more violence than was necessary to overpower her, because that is the kind of angry, vicious man he is. Hurt and shocked, she flagged down a police car.<br />' Would you recognise him?' asked one of the officers . 'Yes', she said, though she was bleeding and in pain, and so they all drove around, looking and looking, and then she saw him, at a bus stop, and she cried out, and the police officers jumped out, and jumped on him, and there was her bag, and her phone, and another phone, and some other stolen items that had been reported by other robbed and beaten women. So he was arrested and taken into police custody.<br /><br />And at the police station, Jane, the police officer on duty, interviewed him, and she knew there was something very wrong. Her instincts told her this was not 'just' a mugger, but someone very dangerous indeed. Rather than let him out on bail, she insisted he was kept in the station, and further checks made. (This was in December 2002, five months after the man had got into my flat and left me for dead, and then disappeared.)<br /><br />They took his DNA. And they kept him in custody.<br /><br />And because other police officers and doctors had carefully got every possible particle of forensic evidence from my body and my flat, and had kept sending the DNA samples back to the lab so it could be mixed and they could get a proper, full picture, and because they had tried and tried to find this man, who was not on the UK database ( he was a seventeen-year-old illegal immigrant from Jamaica), and because they had comforted me and told me again and again, <em>we'll get him, Rachel, it is only a matter of time</em>, I had never given up hope. And a few days before Christmas I got a call. There was a DNA match.<br /><br />'We've got him'. In the background I could hear cheering. They had done it, through good police work and determination and instinct, and through the bravery of the other victims who had reported him, especially the woman who said 'That's him, there, at the bus stop', holding a blood-soaked tissue to her face in a police car.<br /><br />That Christmas, the excited police officers told me, I need no longer fear for my life. Whilst I celebrated with my family and friends, he would stay locked up, and I and other women would be safe from him. The relief was indescribable, the gratitude overwhelming. And in January 2004, after endless court battles and fiascos and time-wasting, and him changing his plea, and sacking his counsel, and even trying to escape from the van that took him to court, he was <em>finally</em> sentenced to 15 years in total, 3 to run concurrently, so he would be jailed for 12 years ( which means, six, normally, because of the strange way it works here). I came to every single hearing. I stared him down. I looked at his blank face as they led him away, for the last time. Justice had been done, in the end. And I was glad, and I was proud. We all were.<br /><br />I suppose he will be released in 2009 or 2010. Heaven help us when he is out.<br /><br />Anyway, Jane is still a police detective, and she works with BBC TV producers now as well. And she was calling to ask me if I was interested in making a programme about restorative justice.<br /><br />Now I have always been fascinated by restorative justice. But for it to work, you have to have a victim and an offender who will get something out of it. The offender has to be willing to engage with what he has done and the victim has to think that there can be some healing found by meeting up with the offender.<br /><br />I spoke to the man researching the programme at length. I am going to keep talking to him. But I do not think I am the right subject for this programme. I don't know that I want the exposure, nor do I think it will be a fair programme, given that I hold all the power. I am not sure, either, that rape is the right subject for restorative justice. I cannot think of anything to say to my attacker, because I do not think he is <em>capable</em> of any feelings other than anger and self-pity. The only thing I think of, when I think of him, is relief that he is locked up, and pride that I had a hand in it.<br /><br />I will write more on restorative justice later, because I am still thinking about it.<br /><br />The final TV thing was <a href="http://www.iaindale.blogspot.com/">Iain</a> asking me to be on <a href="http://www.18doughtystreet.com/blog/">18 Doughty Street </a>on Monday night. I feel very guilty that I still haven't done a report for the station. The last few weeks have been very tied up with helping the police with ongoing stuff, and lawyers, and meetings, and charity stuff, and 7/7 survivor group stuff, and dealing with the fall-out after reliving the worst moments of my life again and again, and I have been too drained to record a straight-to camera piece as well. But the acupuncture and herbs are helping me rebalance, and I am feeling fine again. So I said yes to Iain, and thank you, and see you on Monday night, and I had better go and swot up on current affairs now.<br /><br />And maybe I will get to talk about something other than rape and terrorism, who knows? Hope so. Life is very rich, these days, with a lot of things to rejoice in and be interested in.<br /><br />But the bad stuff is there too, and right now, it is crowding in. Maybe it is a good thing. Maybe I need to go back there to come out the other side, free. I can write about politics, but the personal is the political, these days. I walked out of an advertising job, and into a new life, where I write, and I think, and I do what feels more true to myself. For years I have kept up my shield. Even now, I still keep it up, to protect me from the strange malice of strangers.<br /><br />I worked hard to make this life, which I love and appreciate, and I am going to keep living it, the way I want to live, regardless of the attacks. Because I know most strangers are not like this; most people are kind, and compassionate, and have wounds of their own, and live their lives with courage and dignity, and do not seek to abuse and lash out at others, in a spiteful attempt to manage their own obvious misery and pain.<br /><br />So. Next up. Restorative justice. And the role of therapeutic intervention.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

The bomb went off  about 7 feet behind me. 26 people died in that blast and 340 were maimed and wounded.
52 passengers died in the London blasts. Over 700 were injured. Thousands were frightened and affected by the blasts.

This blog is dedicated to the victims of all bomb attacks. It's also dedicated
to two men who changed my life when they told me I was a writer and must keep writing: Fergal Keane, journalist/writer and Gary Duffy, the UK editor of the BBC News website.

And to my fiancé J who is a wonderful, wonderful man whom I am honoured to share my life with.

And to my family, friends & fellow passengers from whom I have recieved so much love and support.
