## installing redcar from github

this guide covers installation using gentoo
for installation on another distribution, you need to adopt INSTALL.txt (in redcar's root) to your distribution, and then jump to 'installing redcar'

## pre-installation (gentoo)

The following packages need to be emerged:

- dev-libs/libgee (requires overlay)
- dev-lang/vala (requires unmasking)
- ruby-dbus (requires github)
- dev-libs/oniguruma
- dev-ruby/ruby-gnome2
- dev-ruby/ruby-gtksourceview (not actually required, at time of writing redcar uses a bundled copy in vendor/)
- dev-ruby/ruby-gconf2
- dev-ruby/ruby-gtkmozembed

## dev-libs/libgee

$ su
$ mkdir -p /usr/local/portage/dev-libs/libgee
$ cd /usr/local/portage/dev-libs/libgee
$ wget http://gpo.zugaina.org/AJAX/Ebuild/90423
$ ebuild libgee* digest
$ echo "dev-libs/libgee **" >> /etc/portage/packages.keywords

## dev-libs/vala

$ su
$ echo "dev-libs/vala" >> /etc/portage/package.kewords

## ruby-dbus

$ git clone git clone git://github.com/sdague/ruby-dbus.git
$ cd ruby-dbus
$ less README

make some config changes if you want

$ su
$ ruby setup.rb all

## other packages

Install them with whatever emerge command you want, e.g.

$ su
$ emerge --quiet dev-libs/oniguruma dev-ruby/ruby-gnome2 dev-ruby/ruby-gtksourceview dev-ruby/ruby-gconf2 dev-ruby/ruby-gtkmozembed

## installing gems

(straight out of INSTALL.txt in redcar's root)

$ sudo gem install oniguruma activesupport rspec cucumber hoe open4 zerenity

## installing redcar

$ git clone git://github.com/danlucraft/redcar.git
$ cd redcar
$ git clone git://github.com/danlucraft/redcar-bundles.git textmate
$ cd vendor

at this point you need to decide how you want to deal with ruby-gtksourceview and gtkmateview
there are two options - either just grab the copy bundled with 0.1 of redcar, or change redcar itself to use another copy

if you want to change redcar, you need to modify plugins/redcar/tasks/build.rake so that it deals properly with your installs
you will also need to change the require(s) in plugins/edit_view/edit_view.rb

initially I tried the following:

$ git clone git://github.com/danlucraft/gtkmateview.git

then, remove the task which compiles ruby-gtksourceview (in build.rake) and change the require to use the version installed by portage
this gave run-time errors for me

easiest is to do the following:

$ cd ~/some/folder
$ wget http://cloud.github.com/downloads/danlucraft/redcar/redcar-0.1.tar.gz
$ tar xzvf redcar-0.1.tar.gz (note that this extracts to redcar/, be careful of over-writing your git copy - you might want to rename it first)
$ ln -s /path/to/redcar-0.1/vendor/gtksourceview2 /path/to/redcar.git/vendor

if you didn't clone gtkmateview, or are having problems, you can do the same trick

$ ln -s /path/to/redcar-0.1/vendor/gtkmateview /path/to/redcar.git/vendor

## finishing up

$ rake build
$ bin/redcar
